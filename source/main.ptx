      <title>Modules for algebraic properties and arithmetic</title>

      <introduction>
        <p>
          The teaching of arithmetic in elementary school involves rules in one way or another.
          But what are the <q>right rules</q>? A satisfactory answer to this question is likely impossible,
          but in any curriculum, we can say what rules are most <em>fundamental</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Three rules form the foundation of every method in arithmetic:
          the <term>commutative</term>, <term>associative</term>, and <term>distributive</term> properties.
          These modules attempt to build familiarity with these properties,
          and equip teachers to explain the procedures taught in their classrooms.
